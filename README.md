insert-require
==============
`insert-require` is a super simple vim plugin. All it does is bind a leader key
that inserts the boilerplate Javascript module 'require' code. It'll save you
22 keypresses each time you invoke it!

Just hit `<Leader>r`:

```
Enter module name:async
```

becomes

```
var async = require('async');
```
