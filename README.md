I Require You
=============
`i-require-you` is a super simple vim plugin for Javascript developers who are
bored of typing

```
var foo = require('foo');
```

statements over and over again.

Installation
------------
If you're using the wonderful [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen),
clone this repository in your `.vim/bundle` directory and you're ready to go!

Usage
-----
Just hit `<Leader>r` in a `javascript` file, and enter the module name:


![before](http://noffle.github.io/i-require-you/iry_0.png)

then becomes

![after](http://noffle.github.io/i-require-you/iry_1.png)

That's it! A savings of 22 keypresses each time it's invoked.

Alternatives
------------
If this functionality seems a little too heavyweight for you as a plugin,
consider a more generic snippet plugin like
[Ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips). (The author certainly has.)
