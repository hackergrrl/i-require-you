I Require You
=============
`i-require-you` is a super simple vim plugin for Javascript developers who are
bored of typing

```
var foo = require('foo');
```

statements over and over again.

Usage
-----
Just hit `<Leader>r` in a `javascript` file, and enter the module name:

```
Enter module name:async
```

then becomes

```
var async = require('async');
```

That's it! A savings of 22 keypresses each time it's invoked.
